Lab 3 Readme

When the scene is started, the balls will be falling at a steady rate. If the user wants to increase the number of balls, they should press the up arrow. In order to decrease the number of balls, the down arrow should be pressed. It can also be turned off by pressing down once the balls are at a minimum. 

The original idea was to implement rain but it seemed more feasible to implement a ball bouncing than rain splattering.
