When the scene is started, the rain will be falling at a steady rate. Note that if the simulation runs for too long, it may begin to slow down. If the user wants to increase the amount of rain, they should press the up arrow. In order to decrease the amount of rain, the down arrow should be pressed. It can also be turned off by pressing down once the rain is at a minimum (which is the starting amount).
